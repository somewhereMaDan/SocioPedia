Redux is a JavaScript library used to maintain and update data across multiple components in an application

redux-persist -> so that we could selectively store the state into local storage if we need to (like if user close the tab the info would still be there because it's stored in local storage)

react-dropzone -> this component will handle file upload and file handling on the frontend so we can send it to the backend

formik -> for form handling, yup -> with validation

All packagesz -> npm i react-redux @reduxjs/toolkit redux-persist react-dropzone dotenv formik yup react-router-dom@6 @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled @mui/icons-material
